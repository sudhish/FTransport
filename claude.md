GET    /api/transfers/{id}         # Get transfer details
DELETE /api/transfers/{id}         # Cancel active transfer
GET    /api/transfers/{id}/status  # Get current progress
WS     /ws/transfers/{id}          # Real-time progress stream

POST   /api/auth/login             # User authentication
GET    /api/auth/me                # Current user profile
POST   /api/drives/validate        # Validate source URL

```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- UI responsiveness: <200ms for status updates

### Reliability
- 99.5% uptime during business hours
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Transaction rollback for failed transfers
- Complete audit trail for compliance

### Security
- OAuth 2.0 authentication for all drive access
- Service account credentials for NotebookLM Enterprise
- Encrypted data in transit (HTTPS/TLS 1.3)
- No persistent storage of user credentials

### Scalability
- Support 100+ concurrent users
- Horizontal scaling with multiple Prefect workers
- Redis-backed task queue for load distribution
- Database connection pooling

## Success Metrics
- **Transfer Success Rate**: >98% successful completion
- **User Adoption**: 80% of pilot users complete at least one transfer
- **Performance**: Average transfer time <5 minutes for 100MB datasets
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating on ease of use

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (4 weeks)
- Basic web UI with transfer form
- Google Drive source support only
- Simple file copying to landing zone
- Basic progress tracking

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (3 weeks)
